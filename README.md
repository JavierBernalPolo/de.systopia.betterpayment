# BetterPayment Payment Processor for CiviCRM

A SYSTOPIA developed integration of Germany based payment provider [BetterPayment](https://betterpayment.de/en/). This is an **IPN implementation**, 
meaning  your donors will be redirected to a separate form provided by the BetterPayment servers. 
This has the advantage that none of the sensitive information (like credit card numbers)
will be processed or even seen by CiviCRM or you server.

**Disclaimer**: This module has only been tested with credit card payment methods so far.
